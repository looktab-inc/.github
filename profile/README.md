## TINJI - Community driven foodie curation service

Tinji is a Community-driven foodie curation service. We eat everyday but we are always hesitating about what to eat. There are tons of apps that share restaurant ratings, most notably Yelp, which is a $2.3 Billion market cap. Users write reviews on Google and restaurant apps, and unwittingly promote restaurants on social media, but they are not rewarded for doing so. We solve this problem with Tinji. Tinji is a community-driven foodie curation service that reduces users' browsing time and rewards them for leaving a review of a restaurant. Users can earn rewards for recommending restaurants by owning your reviews as NFTs.
